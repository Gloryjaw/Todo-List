## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [FramerMotions](https://motion.dev/) - Animation Library
- [DndKit](https://docs.dndkit.com/) - Drag and Drop

### What I learned

I learned a lot of things about drag and drop functionalites and framer motion (this is my first time animating with javascript!!)


### Continued development

I will read more about drag and drop (dnd kit library docs) and framer motion (animation library). My goal is to implement it in my time table software
